                        There is a popular notion that customizing &

                        very large extent as most of the consulting companies
                        customizing an ERP will have very limited knowledge of
                        the capabilities of SAP B1 or they might have worked in

                        In the current times, with the advent of software for
                        every need, there are chances that every business has a
                        system to keep track of their business in some form of a
                        legacy system or the other. There are times when you
                        feel the software to be a mismatch for your business, an
                        obsolete one or it is just not easy to use & you start
                        looking out for a new ERP like SAP Business One. The
                        first fear that strikes your mind like a thunderbolt is
                        the fate of old business data that was maintained &
                        preserved in some form and the possibility of migrating
                        the data into the new ERP. As proven SAP Partners and
                        having handled such situations a hundred times, we not
                        only make sure that your old data is migrated in SAP
                        Business One but also see that the old data is used in
                        multiple ways to provide quality insights that were not
                        available previously and also resulting in better
                        understanding of your business..

                        SAP is the third largest independent software supplier
                        in the world with more than 12 million users, 121,000
                        installations worldwide, more than 1,500 SAP partners,
                        over 25 industry-specific business solutions, and more
                        than 41,200 customers in 120 countries. SAP has come a
                        long way from 1972 when five former IBM employees set up
                        Systems, Applications, and Processing in Data Management
                        â€“ thankfully shortened to SAP â€“ in Mannheim, Germany.
                        Their intention was to â€œdevelop standard application
                        software for real-time business processing. The first
                        fruit of this ambition was R/1, followed by R/2. Close
                        to 5 decades of R&D has resulted in such world-class
                        products like SAP Business One. As SAP Partners, we are
                        proud to be associated with a company with such a

                        The formula for the successful implementation of an ERP
                        for any business is the feature set of the ERP combined
                        with the flexibility of the implementation partner. When
                        there is a perfect match between these two factors, the
                        output usually will be of top quality. When either of
                        the factors falters, this results in a huge waste of
                        time, money & effort for both organization & the
                        implementation partner. As everyone knows that SAP
                        Business One is the numero-uno ERP for small & medium
                        enterprises, there is a huge responsibility on our

                        SAP in implementing SAP Business One. As SAP partners

                        The majority of the implementation partners feel that
                        their job ends once they are done with implementing the
                        ERP. They often forget the fact that employees are the
                        ones who will decide the success of an implementation
                        and there is a popular misconception that one should
                        impress the Owner or the key decision maker of the
                        organization at the time of implementing the ERP. This
                        results in a flop implementation when the employees of
                        the organization resist the thought of adapting
                        themselves to a new system because of numerous reasons.
                        The responsibility of motivation & training lies with
                        both the organization & the SAP Partners and this leads
                        to the success of the implementation. As preferred SAP
