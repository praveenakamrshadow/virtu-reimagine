                        The emergence of banking has been dated back to 2000 BC
                        in ancient Babylonia. One would expect the industry,
                        which is probably as old as civilization, to have a
                        stable and fully understood business model. Nothing can
                        be further from the truth.

                        The banks of today have to re-invent themselves every
                        decade to maintain their competitive edge. Digital
                        technology has revolutionized the banking landscape and
                        has opened up several new modes of doing business. At
                        the same time, banks have to embrace an environment of
                        increased volatility and comply with significant
                        regulatory oversight.
