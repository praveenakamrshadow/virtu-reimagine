                    Virtu Tech Solutions, We are experts in Native Mobile
                    Application Development, Product development & Web
                    Application Development Services. What makes us unique is
                    our capability to exclusively work with Tech companies,
                    Media Companies, and Marketing & Advertising Agencies. We
                    strongly believe that you will be impressed with our work
                    and offerings. Virtu Tech Solutions follows a Step-wise
                    approach in the development process. From gathering initial
                    information to the development & deployment of your Project,
                    and lastly to maintenance. we provide comprehensive design,
                    development, and support services. Analysis – In this phase,
                    we define the major project goals and schedule, find the
                    target audience and tailor the design solution to your set
                    of goals. We will analyze the website requirements in detail
                    and finalize the scope. We prepare a strategic plan to deal
                    with renewed Information Architecture and obtain project
                    plan sign-off. Design – Using the information gathered we
                    build a plan for your project and create a detailed
                    wireframe. Keeping in mind all the goals and priorities we
                    will begin to design graphic and layout samples. Paper
                    wireframes and click-through mockups are developed in this
                    phase. Development – This is where your project is created.
                    We take all of the individual graphic elements from the
                    prototype and use them to create the functional site. We
                    also take your content and distribute it throughout the
                    site, in the appropriate areas. QA and UAT – At this point,
                    we attend to the final details and test your web site. We
                    test things such as the complete functionality of forms or
                    other scripts, we test for last minute compatibility issues
                    (viewing differences in different web browsers), ensuring
                    that the site is optimized to be viewed properly in the most
                    recent browser versions. Launch – Once we receive your final
                    approval, it is time to deliver the site. Here we quickly
                    test again to make sure that all files have been uploaded
                    correctly, and that the site continues to be fully
                    functional. This marks the official launch of your site, as
                    it is now viewable to the public. Maintenance and Support –
                    After the Project is deployed and fully functional, we
                    provide complete support to our clients, including
                    evaluation, on-site training for content and site
                    management, upgrades with the latest technologies, and any
                    required updates or patches.
